/// - `magicblock_program` which supports account mutations, etc.

/// We don't support the following builtin programs:
///
/// - `vote_program` since we have no votes
/// - `stake_program` since we don't support staking in our validator
/// - `config_program` since we don't support configuration (_Add configuration data to the chain and the
///   list of public keys that are permitted to modify it_)
/// - `solana_bpf_loader_deprecated_program` because it's deprecated
/// - `solana_bpf_loader_program` since we use the `solana_bpf_loader_upgradeable_program` instead
/// - `zk_token_proof_program` it's behind a feature flag (`feature_set::zk_token_sdk_enabled`) in
///   the solana validator and we don't support it yet
