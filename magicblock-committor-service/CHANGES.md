- Persister changed from reqid & bundle_id format to message_id. Meaning row created per message. A particular Row tracking lifespan of Intent
- Persister will be passed along into Executors & Scheduler for them to update Intent statuses during execution
- No notion of bundles anymore, we represent things by Intent id
