## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, **do not open a public issue**.

Please report it privately via **GitHub Security Advisories**:

- Go to: **Security → Advisories → New draft advisory**
- Or use the “Report a vulnerability” button on the Security tab

Include:
- a clear description of the issue
- affected components or configs
- minimal repro steps (if possible)
- potential impact (funds, state, availability, integrity)

Please avoid public disclosure until we have acknowledged and addressed the report.

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- validator runtime behavior
- consensus / state handling
- RPC / API surfaces
- config parsing and defaults
- on-disk formats and migrations

---

## Response Expectations

We aim to:
- acknowledge reports within a few business days
- assess severity and impact promptly
- coordinate disclosure when appropriate

Thanks for helping keep the codbase safe and predictable.
